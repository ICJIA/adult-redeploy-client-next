      "content": "<style>\n\tdetails {margin-top: 20px;}\n\tsummary {font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 25px}\np {margin-top: 25px !important}\nul, ol {margin-top: 25px;}\n\t</style>\n\n<details>\n <summary>\n\t What jurisdictions are eligible to participate in Adult Redeploy Illinois?\n</summary>\nAll counties in good standing with the State of Illinois are eligible to apply for funding through Adult Redeploy Illinois to establish or expand local services to divert non-violent offenders from the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC). Counties may apply for planning and/or implementation grants individually or as a group of counties, such as a judicial circuit. A lead county must be identified as the grantee.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>\n\t What populations are eligible to participate in Adult Redeploy Illinois?\n</summary>\nThe Crime Reduction Act (Public Act 96-0761) excludes violent offenders from Adult Redeploy Illinois. In addition, there are a number of offenses that disqualify people from alternatives to incarceration based on statute. These disqualifying offenses are listed in the Unified Code of Corrections (730 ILCS et seq.), and are on the Adult Redeploy Illinois web site (http://www.icjia.org/redeploy). Technical parole violators are excluded from the program as they are under IDOC supervision.\n\n\nFrom the pool of non-violent offenders that qualify for alternatives to incarceration, a jurisdiction may want to further reduce the baseline by focusing on a specific group of offenders, e.g., drug-addicted, mentally ill. The strongest proposals for implementation funds will divert the largest number of non-violent offenders from prison without negatively impacting public safety.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>\n\t How is the program-eligible population for Adult Redeploy Illinois determined and the 25% reduction goal calculated?\n</summary>\nThe reduction goal is calculated from a baseline number that will be negotiated between the staff of Redeploy Illinois and the jurisdiction based on the agreed-upon definition of the program-eligible population and then approved by the Oversight Board. The program-eligible population for Adult Redeploy Illinois must exclude individuals convicted of violent and other disqualifying offenses.\n\nThe local Adult Redeploy Illinois planning body may choose to target all of the remaining non-violent offenders, or choose a subset of all other eligible individuals. The baseline number is the average number in that program-eligible population over the prior three years. The baseline number is then multiplied by 25% to arrive at the reduction goal in the number of IDOC admissions from that program-eligible population for the Adult Redeploy Illinois program.\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n <summary>\nWhat is the penalty if the reduction goal is not met?\n</summary>\nAs an accountability mechanism, the Crime Reduction Act stipulates that a penalty shall be assessed to a county or judicial circuit that does not meet its reduction goal, resulting in a portion of the grant funds to be reimbursed to the Oversight Board. The intent is for sites to meet their goals; any penalties would follow technical assistance and extensive negotiations between the Oversight Board and the sites.\n\nThe amount of the penalty assessed will be left to the discretion of the Oversight Board, which shall take into consideration factors affecting the jurisdictions ability to meet the required reduction, including whether the failure to meet the reduction was beyond the control of the jurisdiction or other extenuating or mitigating circumstances. The Oversight Board has set the maximum penalty at no more than one-half of the annual marginal cost of commitment to IDOC for each admission to prison short of the reduction goal. (In FY09, the average annual marginal cost of incarceration was approximately $5,000; hence, the reimbursement to the Oversight Board would not exceed $2,500 per prison admission).\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>\nHow and when will the performance of local ARI programs be measured to determine if the reduction goal has been met?\n</summary>\nIn the initial implementation phase, each pilot site will be allowed a ramp-up period to get the program elements in place before performance measurement begins in earnest. Sites will be required to submit data on a regular basis with which to gauge progress toward the reduction goal. At the six-month mark, there will be a status check-in at each site, comparing IDOC commitment numbers to the data submitted by the jurisdictions. The purpose of the check-in will be to identify any problems, negotiate compromises, recommend corrective action, and offer technical assistance. The sites will be assessed on progress towards their reduction goals at the end of the grant period.\n\nProgram effectiveness will be tracked through an independent evaluation conducted by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA), and through required regular reporting. Evaluation results will be part of the required annual reporting to the Governor and General Assembly per the Crime Reduction Act, and shared with the public and policy makers in an ongoing effort to improve public safety and save taxpayer dollars.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>\nHow is Adult Redeploy Illinois funded?\n</summary>\nThe Adult Redeploy Illinois program was initially funded with state SFY2010 General Revenue Fund (GRF) dollars allocated by Governor Quinn to start up the program. A one-time, multi-year federal grant from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG), administered by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA), supported the pilot phase of the program, 2010-2013. Adult Redeploy Illinois is currently funded through annual state GRF appropriations through ICJIA: $2 million in SFY2013 and $7 million in SFY2014.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>\nAre there any restrictions on how ARI funds are spent?\n</summary>\nFunds shall be used to support a local plan approved by the ARIOB that is intended to meet the goals of Adult Redeploy Illinois. Adult Redeploy Illinois funds may not be used for capital expenditures, renovations or remodeling. In addition, Adult Redeploy Illinois funds shall not be used to supplant existing county-funded programs.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>\nHow will the local ARI programs be evaluated?\n</summary>\nThe Crime Reduction Act calls for a rigorous evaluation process at the program level and the site level with standardized performance measurements to confirm the effectiveness of the services in reducing crime. Specifically the legislation requires the development of a performance measurement system that includes but is not limited to the following key performance indicators, some of which are intentionally focused on the important positive outcomes the program is designed to achieve:\n\n- Employment rates\n- Successful completion of substance abuse treatment program\n- Payment of victim restitution\n- Recidivism\n- Rate of revocations\n\t\nJurisdictions are required to include a performance measurement system as part of their local plan and to provide data annually for evaluation purposes. In addition, researchers from ICJIA will be conducting a long-term evaluation of the program.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>\nCan ARI as an initiative be used to expand or create specialty courts, such as drug and mental health courts?\n</summary>\nYes. Some jurisdictions are using the Adult Redeploy Illinois program as an opportunity to create or expand existing drug and other specialty courts. Funds can be used to increase court staff for the program and boost the capacity of local service providers.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>\nCan ARI implementation funds be used for court services staff?\n</summary>\nAdult Redeploy Illinois implementation funds can be used for example to hire additional probation officers or pay probation officers to work on the ARI program (as long as their previous positions are back-filled). Funds can also be used to retain probation officer positions that would otherwise be eliminated due to budget cuts, etc.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>\nWho makes the funding decisions?\n</summary>\n\nThe members of the Adult Redeploy Illinois Oversight Board are designated by law. The Oversight Board includes representatives from state agencies, local probation departments and community-based organizations, and is co-chaired by the Director of the Department of Corrections and the Secretary of the Department of Human Services. The Oversight Board is charged with increasing effective alternatives to incarceration and building community capacity.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n <summary>\nHow do jurisdictions apply for funds?\n</summary>\n\nOpportunities to apply for planning and/or implementation grants are announced periodically, as funds are available.  The application process developed by the ARIOB includes:\n\n- Initial planning grant phase: Providing up to $30,000 to convene stakeholders and analyze data over a 90-120-day period.\n- Completion of local plan using Standard Plan Template, submitted to ARIOB for approval.\n- Site implementation grant phase: Providing competitive grants for up to 12 months of implementation, and renewable annually.\n- Performance measured as to progress toward goal of 25 percent reduction in prison commitments from eligible non-violent offender population.\n\nLocal plans are reviewed and applications for implementation funding are scored according to completeness and accuracy with respect to the following elements:\n\n1. Executive Summary (5 points)\n2. Description of and Justification for the Target Population (25 points)\n3. Description of the Planning Partners (10 points)\n4. Description of gaps in Sanctions and Services (15 points)\n5. Description of the Proposed Adult Redeploy Illinois Program Model (30 points)\n6. Timeline (5 points)\n7. Budget (10 points)\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n",
