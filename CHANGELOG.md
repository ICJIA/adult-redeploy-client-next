### Remove unused Netlify Functions; pin build Node version

Netlify build log was warning about deprecated Node 16 functions runtime. Investigation showed the only deployed function was a `"Hello, World"` stub that nothing in the app calls. Removed the functions plumbing entirely rather than upgrading the runtime for code that serves no purpose.

- Deleted `src/lambda/` (source) and `netlify/` (webpack-4 bundled output).
- `package.json` — Removed `netlify-lambda` dependency; removed `build:lambda` and `start:lambda` scripts; dropped `build:lambda` step from the `deploy` script.
- `netlify.toml` — Removed `Functions = "netlify"`. Added `[build.environment]` block with `NODE_VERSION = "22"` so the build container is explicit instead of relying on `.nvmrc` detection.
- `src/config.json` — Removed the `status` object that referenced a `/.netlify/functions/status` endpoint that never existed in this repo.
- `src/store.js` — Removed dead `buildStatusUrl`/`fetchData` helpers, the `setApiStatus` action (whose body was commented out with a hardcoded 200 bypass), the `SET_API_STATUS` mutation, the `apiStatus` state, and the unused `isApiReady` getter. Net: 58 lines of dead code gone.
- `src/App.vue` — Removed the `setApiStatus` dispatch call.

Lint clean. Dev-server smoke test: `http://localhost:8080` Lighthouse A11y 100, Perf 82, LCP 3.2s. No functional change expected in prod beyond the Netlify warning clearing.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-04-16

### Performance and hygiene pass

Addresses Lighthouse prod results (desktop Perf 55, LCP 25.2s) by removing the root-level render-blocking gate. Dev Perf moved from 78 → 93 on the same URL after the change; real prod impact TBD after deploy.

- `src/App.vue` — Removed the global `loading` loader gate that blocked first paint until `getAllSections`, `setApiStatus`, `getAppCount`, and `getArticleCount` all resolved serially. Shell and route view now render immediately; config and searchIndex load synchronously from bundled JSON; sections/appCount/articleCount fire as background promises and populate the nav/footer when ready. Dropped the `Loader` component import and associated template branch.
- `vue.config.js` — Added `configureWebpack` hook that enables Terser `drop_console: true` for production builds, stripping the 104 `console.log` calls across the source tree from prod bundles without touching development builds.
- `src/router.js` — Wrapped the `/sandbox` route in a `NODE_ENV !== "production"` conditional spread so the `Sandbox` chunk is excluded from production builds entirely.
- `src/services/Content.js` — Fixed `getGATAFunding` missing `await` on `getGATAFundingQuery()` (was returning an unresolved Promise). Now awaits and returns `.data` consistent with sibling functions.

### Known follow-ups surfaced during the pass

- `v-data-table` views (`/news`, `/resources`, `/about/meetings`) trigger axe `td-has-header` (WCAG 1.3.1) — cells not associated with column headers. Lighthouse a11y still scores 100 but a thorough audit will flag it.
- `store.js` retains dead `fetchData`/`buildStatusUrl` block and hard-coded `SET_API_STATUS(200)` bypass.
- Image pipeline still ships ~109 KiB of unoptimized assets (seal, nav/footer logos); `image.icjia.cloud` responsive variants would address it.
- 167 npm vulns (18 critical, 39 high); Vue 2 / Vuetify 2 / Vue CLI 4 stack is EOL.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-04-15

### Siteimprove A11y Fix — "All roles are invalid"

Removed redundant `role` attributes from semantic HTML5 elements that already carry the implicit role. Resolves Siteimprove WCAG 2.1 SC 4.1.2 occurrences across `/`, `/programs`, `/grants`, `/news`, `/apps`, `/resources`, and `/search`.

- `src/components/AppNav.vue` — Removed `role="navigation"` from `<nav>`.
- `src/components/AppDrawer.vue` — Removed `role="navigation"` from `<v-navigation-drawer>` (renders as `<nav>`).
- `src/components/AppFooter.vue` — Removed `role="contentinfo"` from `<v-footer>` (renders as `<footer>`).
- `src/App.vue` — Removed `role="main"` from `<v-content>` (renders as `<main>`).
- `src/components/ListTableResource.vue`, `ListTableNews.vue`, `ListTableMeeting.vue` — Removed `role="cell"` from `<td>` (implicit cell role within native tables).
- `src/App.vue` — Moved the route-change live region (`aria-live="polite"` / `role="status"`) inside `<v-content>` so its announcement text ("Navigated to …") is contained by the `<main>` landmark. Resolves Siteimprove "Text not included in an ARIA landmark".
- `src/App.vue` — Wrapped the skip link and `<app-nav>` in a `<header>` element so the skip-link text sits inside a `banner` landmark on every route. Resolves the same Siteimprove rule for the only remaining text-outside-landmark on every page.
- `src/main.js` — Overrode the NProgress template to drop `role="bar"` and `role="spinner"` (both are not valid WAI-ARIA roles). Used `aria-hidden="true"` on the bar and pinned `barSelector` to the `.bar` class. Resolves Siteimprove "All roles are invalid" for the NProgress loading bar.
- `src/css/app.css`, `src/App.vue` — Replaced the `.sr-only` utility (which Font Awesome's CSS overrides with `overflow: hidden`) with a `.visually-hidden` class using `clip-path: inset(50%)` and no `overflow: hidden`. Switched the route-announcement live region to use it. Resolves Siteimprove "Text is clipped when resized" (WCAG 1.4.4) false-positive on the screen-reader-only announcement.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-04-09

### Lighthouse Audit Fixes

- `src/components/AppFooter.vue` — Changed ICJIA link from `http://` to `https://` to eliminate insecure request.
- `src/App.vue` — Set canonical URL on initial page load with `publicPath` prefix. Unified conflicting `min-height` values (68vh/75vh). Removed debug `console.log`.
- `public/index.html` — Removed deprecated `promise-polyfill` and `fetch-polyfill` scripts (native in all supported browsers). Replaced expired FontAwesome kit with free CDN CSS (`font-awesome/5.15.4`).
- `src/main.js` — Removed deprecated `babel-polyfill` import and IE-era prototype shims. Removed `vue-analytics` (Google Analytics) — replaced with no-op `$ga` stub since site uses Plausible.
- `netlify.toml` — Cleaned up CSP: removed FontAwesome kit and Google Analytics domains.
- `src/components/HomeCarousel.vue` — Added descriptive `aria-label` to "Learn More" button for SEO link-text audit.
- `src/components/HomeMeetings.vue` — Added descriptive `aria-label` to "Read more" buttons.
- `src/components/ListTableNews.vue` — Scoped global `td` styles to `.newsTable` to prevent cross-component CLS. Added `role="cell"` to expanded rows.
- `src/components/ListTableMeeting.vue` — Added `role="cell"` to expanded rows.
- `src/components/ListTableResource.vue` — Scoped global `td` styles to `.meetingTable`. Added `role="cell"` to expanded rows. Removed `console.log`.
- `src/components/AppNav.vue` — Added `height` attribute to nav logo for layout stability.
- `src/components/AppFooter.vue` — Added `height="29"` to footer logo.
- `src/components/HomeCarousel.vue` — Set correct `aspect-ratio`, added `eager` loading and `width` for LCP optimization.
- `public/index.html` — Added `preconnect` hints for Google Fonts and cdnjs. Upgraded Google Fonts to CSS2 API with `display=swap`. Trimmed unused font weights. Deferred animate.css loading.
- `src/App.vue` — Made canonical a computed property based on `$route.path`, so it's immediately available on every page without waiting for store config to load. Removed manual assignments from watcher and `created` hook. Added `vmid` to vue-meta canonical link so it replaces the static fallback without creating duplicates.
- `public/index.html` — Added static canonical with `data-vmid="canonical"` as fallback for Lighthouse (vue-meta replaces it after mount).
- `public/index.html` — Async-loaded all external CSS (Google Fonts, FontAwesome, animate.css) via `media="print" onload` pattern to eliminate render-blocking. Combined 3 Google Font requests into 1.
- `src/components/SiteIllinois.vue` — Replaced all jQuery calls (30 references) with vanilla JS. jQuery was never actually installed as a dependency, causing `ReferenceError` on the map page.
- `src/services/Markdown.js` — Replace generic CMS link text ("here", "click here", etc.) with descriptive text derived from the link URL slug. Allow `aria-label` through XSS filter.
- `src/components/HomeAbout.vue` — Auto-size CMS images missing `height` attribute after render, using natural aspect ratio.
- `src/views/SiteDescriptions.vue` — Fixed `[...item]` spread on non-iterable slot scope object (pre-existing `TypeError` on `/sites` page).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-03

### Accessibility Best Practices

#### Skip to main content
- `src/App.vue` - Added skip link as first focusable element, targeting `#content-top`.
- `src/css/app.css` - Skip link styled offscreen by default, slides into view on keyboard focus with high-contrast teal/yellow styling.

#### Landmark roles
- `src/components/AppNav.vue` - Wrapped in `<nav role="navigation" aria-label="Main navigation">`.
- `src/components/AppFooter.vue` - Added `role="contentinfo"` and `aria-label="Site footer"`.
- `src/components/AppDrawer.vue` - Added `role="navigation"` and `aria-label="Mobile navigation"`.

#### Focus management on route change
- `src/App.vue` - On every Vue Router navigation, focus moves to `#content-top` (`tabindex="-1"`) so keyboard users start at the top of the new page content.

#### Screen reader route announcements
- `src/App.vue` - Added a visually hidden `aria-live="polite"` region that announces "Navigated to {page title}" on each route change.

#### Visible focus indicators
- `src/css/app.css` - Added global `*:focus-visible` outline (3px solid `#f9a825` yellow) for keyboard navigation. Applied to all interactive elements including Vuetify buttons and links.

#### Reduced motion support
- `src/css/app.css` - Added `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` to disable all CSS animations, transitions, and AOS library effects for users with that OS preference.

#### Screen-reader utility class
- `src/css/app.css` - Added `.sr-only` class for visually hidden but screen-reader-accessible content.

**Initial audit results:** 4 violation types, 244 affected elements across 39 pages.

#### CRITICAL: `button-name` (39 pages, 181 elements)
Buttons missing discernible text.

**Fixes:**
- `src/components/AppNav.vue` - Added `aria-label="Open navigation menu"` to hamburger nav icon; added `aria-label="Search"` to search icon button.
